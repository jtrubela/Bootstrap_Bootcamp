Global Attributes
Reference Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/ <--Insert Item--

class
    The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element. 
        Classes allow CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements 
        via the class selectors or functions like the DOM method document.getElementsByClassName.

        Example: (ltr) (rtl)
        <p dir="ltr">This paragraph is in English and correctly goes left to right.</p>
        <p dir="rtl">This paragraph is in English but incorrectly goes right to left.</p>

dir
    The dir global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates the directionality of the element's text.

id
    The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. 
        Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).



HTML Elements 
Reference Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/ <--Insert Item--

<a>: The Anchor element
    The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, 
        creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, 
        or anything else a URL can address.

        Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. 
        If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <a> element will activate it.

<button>: The Button element
    The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a:
        mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology.
        Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, 
        but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
<body>: The Document Body element
    The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. 
        There can be only one <body> element in a document.

<div>: The Content Division element
    The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. 
        It has no effect on the content or layout until styled 
        in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, 
        or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

<head>: The Document Metadata (Header) element
    The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) 
        about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.

<img>: The Image Embed element
    The <img> HTML element embeds an image into the document.

<li>: The List Item element
    The <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: 
        an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). 
        In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. 
        In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

<nav>: The Navigation Section element
    The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to 
        provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. 
        Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
    
<section>: The Generic Section element
    The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, 
        which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. 
        Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

<script>: The Script element

    The <script> HTML element is used to embed executable code or data; 
        this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. 
        The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.

<span>: The Content Span element
    The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. 
        It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), 
        or because they share attribute values, such as lang. 
        It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. 
        <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline element.
